    "Streaming platforms like Spotify have transformed the music industry, impacting not only how music is consumed but also how data on listener preferences, song popularity, and musical trends are accessed. Understanding the factors that drive a song’s popularity can provide insights for artists and producers looking to create resonant music. While many elements influence popularity—including artist reputation and song structure—lyrics play a critical role by directly conveying emotions and themes that listeners connect with. Our project seeks to explore how specific lyrical themes correlate with song popularity across various genres, highlighting trends that resonate most with audiences on platforms like Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies have explored the role of sentiment analysis in predicting song popularity and genre classification. For instance, a study published in Ultimatics: Jurnal Teknik Informatika developed a BERT-based model to predict song popularity based on sentiment analysis of English song lyrics, achieving a notable accuracy of 87% through oversampling and data preprocessing techniques. This study found that the sentiment expressed in lyrics, such as positivity or negativity, was a significant factor in popularity. By capturing the sentiment with BERT, they successfully linked lyrical sentiment with popularity trends, underscoring the impact of lyrical emotion on audience engagement and song performance 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach was undertaken by Boonyanit and Dahl at Stanford, who aimed to classify songs into genres based solely on lyrical content, using GloVe embeddings and LSTM models to predict genre with an accuracy of 68% at its peak. Their work illuminated the capacity of lyrics to signal genre-related characteristics, especially in distinguishing unique words and recurring themes. By focusing on genre classification, this study underscored how lyrical content often aligns with genre conventions, revealing differences in word choice and thematic style across genres like hip-hop, pop, and rock, despite overlaps 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on these studies, our project diverges by focusing not on predicting popularity or genre independently but on understanding how specific themes within lyrics correlate with popularity across genres like pop, hip-hop, rock, and country. We are not merely classifying songs by sentiment or genre; rather, we are examining genre as a contextual factor in lyrical themes. This will allow us to determine which themes—such as love, nostalgia, or resilience—drive higher engagement in particular genres, offering insights into the preferences of genre-specific audiences. Our findings can aid musicians in tailoring lyrics to align with listener tastes, leveraging data to enhance song impact on streaming platforms.\n",

The Spotify songs dataset, for instance, has over 18,000 tracks, but it primarily features well-known songs and mainstream performers, possibly ignoring the variety of musical genres and up-and-coming musicians. This prejudice may result in inaccurate inferences regarding the topics and emotional components that are common in popular music lyrics.\n",
    "The terms of use for each dataset should be taken into account when collecting data. Copyright regulations must be followed because the lyrics in the dataset are protected by intellectual property laws, their use is restricted to scholarly and non-commercial reasons. We'll make sure that our analysis complies with these restrictions and doesn't improperly reveal copyrighted content. We want to carry out exploratory data analysis at several levels in order to address the biases that have been detected and make sure that hidden factors that can affect our discoveries are carefully taken into account. To find any notable biases, we will first look at the datasets' demographic representation. To make sure our results do not unduly favor popular music, we will analyze whether characteristics, such as lyrical sentiment, correspond with popularity across a variety of genres.\n",

    "To ensure responsible data analysis, we address a number of ethical issues while using the Audio Features and Lyrics of Spotify Songs dataset. We follow fair use rules by concentrating on broad subject trends rather than directly quoting copyrighted lyrics. Furthermore, our study respects the dataset's original use and is solely academic and non-commercial. We will examine more general trends across genres rather than assigning particular themes to specific performers because we acknowledge that lyrics may contain sensitive or personal material. Without disclosing private information, this method preserves the integrity of the analysis. Even if the lyrics are openly accessible, we take care of any personally identifiable information in a responsible manner to prevent invasive or speculative conclusions about the artists based just on the lyrics. By looking at a range of genres and recognizing constraints, we mitigate potential genre biases despite the dataset's emphasis on popular music. Our objective is to advance an inclusive perspective on musical trends and themes.\n",

    "An additional ethical consideration pertains to the findings' equitable impact. We need to be careful about how our analysis might affect how people view certain musical genres or performers, especially if our results imply that some genres are more popular than others. We aim to promote a more inclusive understanding of music data and its implications by being conscious of potential biases and having an open discussion about them. It should be noted that the goal of our project is to determine a connection between the popularity of songs and their lyrical themes, or messages. Our ultimate objective is to maintain moral principles in our study, favorably advancing our knowledge of music popularity while honoring the rights and talents of all participating artists.\n"
