    "Streaming platforms like Spotify have transformed the music industry, impacting not only how music is consumed but also how data on listener preferences, song popularity, and musical trends are accessed. Understanding the factors that drive a song’s popularity can provide insights for artists and producers looking to create resonant music. While many elements influence popularity—including artist reputation and song structure—lyrics play a critical role by directly conveying emotions and themes that listeners connect with. Our project seeks to explore how specific lyrical themes correlate with song popularity across various genres, highlighting trends that resonate most with audiences on platforms like Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies have explored the role of sentiment analysis in predicting song popularity and genre classification. For instance, a study published in Ultimatics: Jurnal Teknik Informatika developed a BERT-based model to predict song popularity based on sentiment analysis of English song lyrics, achieving a notable accuracy of 87% through oversampling and data preprocessing techniques. This study found that the sentiment expressed in lyrics, such as positivity or negativity, was a significant factor in popularity. By capturing the sentiment with BERT, they successfully linked lyrical sentiment with popularity trends, underscoring the impact of lyrical emotion on audience engagement and song performance 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach was undertaken by Boonyanit and Dahl at Stanford, who aimed to classify songs into genres based solely on lyrical content, using GloVe embeddings and LSTM models to predict genre with an accuracy of 68% at its peak. Their work illuminated the capacity of lyrics to signal genre-related characteristics, especially in distinguishing unique words and recurring themes. By focusing on genre classification, this study underscored how lyrical content often aligns with genre conventions, revealing differences in word choice and thematic style across genres like hip-hop, pop, and rock, despite overlaps 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on these studies, our project diverges by focusing not on predicting popularity or genre independently but on understanding how specific themes within lyrics correlate with popularity across genres like pop, hip-hop, rock, and country. We are not merely classifying songs by sentiment or genre; rather, we are examining genre as a contextual factor in lyrical themes. This will allow us to determine which themes—such as love, nostalgia, or resilience—drive higher engagement in particular genres, offering insights into the preferences of genre-specific audiences. Our findings can aid musicians in tailoring lyrics to align with listener tastes, leveraging data to enhance song impact on streaming platforms.\n",

  },
  {

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that lyrical themes identified through sentiment analysis will correlate distinctly with song popularity across Spotify’s English-language genres from 2000 to 2023. We expect themes like \"love\" and \"nostalgia\" to be more prevalent in Pop due to its universal appeal and focus on emotional connections. In contrast, \"empowerment,\" \"struggle,\" and \"anger\" will likely dominate in Rap, reflecting its emphasis on resilience, self-expression, and cultural commentary. For Rock, we anticipate themes of \"anger,\" \"struggle,\" and \"celebration,\" aligning with its high-energy, rebellious tone. Similarly, \"love,\" \"hope,\" and \"struggle\" are predicted to appear most often in R&B, capturing its relational and soulful storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction is based on our understanding of how different genres cater to specific emotional and cultural experiences. For example, Pop often explores personal connections, while Rap delves into themes of resilience and social commentary. Our thinking also draws from personal experiences and observations of recurring themes in chart-topping songs over the past decade."

    "# Ethics & Privacy"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Several ethical concerns that are essential to the data science process were discovered when we examined the datasets, especially those about prejudice, privacy, and intellectual property. The three datasets we are using—the Audio Features and Lyrics of Spotify Songs, ~60,000 Spotify Songs, and 150K Lyrics Labeled with Spotify Valence—each raises different ethical questions about data representation, analysis, and equitable impact. Since these datasets mostly cover mainstream musicians and popular genres, frequently ignoring obscure or up-and-coming performers and culturally diverse musical forms, one of the key problems is the potential bias in representation. For example, the ~60,000 Spotify Songs dataset contains songs by well-known artists but leaves out a large number of independent musicians, while the 150K Lyrics dataset concentrates on English-language music, potentially excluding non-English or regional genres. This prejudice could tilt the analysis in the direction of Western-centric patterns, producing erroneous or insufficient understandings of the thematic and emotional elements of music. Exploratory analysis will be used to evaluate the datasets' diversity in terms of demographics and genres, and the results will be contextualized to draw attention to these limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these datasets contain metadata like artist and album names, audio features, and song lyrics, copyright, and intellectual property regulations also raise significant ethical issues. Despite being freely accessible for research, the datasets can only be used for academic and non-commercial reasons. Instead of explicitly citing or recreating lyrics from the 150K Lyrics dataset, we will concentrate on topic tendencies, keyword frequency, and general language patterns. In a similar vein, to verify adherence to fair use guidelines, we will examine combined insights rather than specific instances for the Audio Features dataset. We'll manage metadata across all datasets properly to prevent invasive or speculative inferences about specific artists, making sure that sensitive or private stuff is handled with consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of lyrics and metadata is also subject to privacy concerns because lyrical content frequently contains delicate or private issues. We acknowledge that there may be conjecture regarding the artists' personal lives based on their work, even though the datasets do not contain explicitly identifiable personal information. Instead of giving performers specific themes, we will concentrate on trends at the genre level to lessen this. This method respects the artists' privacy and artistic goals while preserving the analysis's integrity. Furthermore, we will make sure that results are presented in an inclusive and balanced way, clearly recognizing the constraints of the dataset and steering clear of inferences that maintain stereotypes or minimize underrepresented genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fair implications of our findings are a crucial ethical factor. For example, the study may unintentionally reinforce prejudices or assumptions about particular genres if it implies that they are more closely linked to particular themes or popularity levels. To avoid this, we will assess the differences in lyrical sentiment and popularity amongst genres, making sure that our findings do not prioritize mainstream music over diversity. To promote an inclusive view of music trends, we will also draw attention to the underrepresentation of new or obscure genres in the databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze lyrical sentiment and popularity across a range of genres during analysis, assess genre representation and demographic diversity before analysis, and make sure that findings are communicated fairly after analysis to identify and correct biases throughout the data science process. Our research intends to promote an inclusive knowledge of musical topics and trends while upholding respect for intellectual property and the rights of all artists by tackling these ethical issues. Our ultimate objective is to investigate the connection between lyrical subjects and song popularity in a manner that respects variety, adheres to moral principles, and offers significant insights into the changing music industry.\n"
