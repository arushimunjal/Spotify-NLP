    "Streaming platforms like Spotify have transformed the music industry, impacting not only how music is consumed but also how data on listener preferences, song popularity, and musical trends are accessed. Understanding the factors that drive a song’s popularity can provide insights for artists and producers looking to create resonant music. While many elements influence popularity—including artist reputation and song structure—lyrics play a critical role by directly conveying emotions and themes that listeners connect with. Our project seeks to explore how specific lyrical themes correlate with song popularity across various genres, highlighting trends that resonate most with audiences on platforms like Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies have explored the role of sentiment analysis in predicting song popularity and genre classification. For instance, a study published in Ultimatics: Jurnal Teknik Informatika developed a BERT-based model to predict song popularity based on sentiment analysis of English song lyrics, achieving a notable accuracy of 87% through oversampling and data preprocessing techniques. This study found that the sentiment expressed in lyrics, such as positivity or negativity, was a significant factor in popularity. By capturing the sentiment with BERT, they successfully linked lyrical sentiment with popularity trends, underscoring the impact of lyrical emotion on audience engagement and song performance 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach was undertaken by Boonyanit and Dahl at Stanford, who aimed to classify songs into genres based solely on lyrical content, using GloVe embeddings and LSTM models to predict genre with an accuracy of 68% at its peak. Their work illuminated the capacity of lyrics to signal genre-related characteristics, especially in distinguishing unique words and recurring themes. By focusing on genre classification, this study underscored how lyrical content often aligns with genre conventions, revealing differences in word choice and thematic style across genres like hip-hop, pop, and rock, despite overlaps 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on these studies, our project diverges by focusing not on predicting popularity or genre independently but on understanding how specific themes within lyrics correlate with popularity across genres like pop, hip-hop, rock, and country. We are not merely classifying songs by sentiment or genre; rather, we are examining genre as a contextual factor in lyrical themes. This will allow us to determine which themes—such as love, nostalgia, or resilience—drive higher engagement in particular genres, offering insights into the preferences of genre-specific audiences. Our findings can aid musicians in tailoring lyrics to align with listener tastes, leveraging data to enhance song impact on streaming platforms.\n",

  },
  {

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that lyrical themes identified through sentiment analysis will correlate distinctly with song popularity across Spotify’s English-language genres from 2000 to 2023. We expect themes like \"love\" and \"nostalgia\" to be more prevalent in Pop due to its universal appeal and focus on emotional connections. In contrast, \"empowerment,\" \"struggle,\" and \"anger\" will likely dominate in Rap, reflecting its emphasis on resilience, self-expression, and cultural commentary. For Rock, we anticipate themes of \"anger,\" \"struggle,\" and \"celebration,\" aligning with its high-energy, rebellious tone. Similarly, \"love,\" \"hope,\" and \"struggle\" are predicted to appear most often in R&B, capturing its relational and soulful storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction is based on our understanding of how different genres cater to specific emotional and cultural experiences. For example, Pop often explores personal connections, while Rap delves into themes of resilience and social commentary. Our thinking also draws from personal experiences and observations of recurring themes in chart-topping songs over the past decade."

    "This dataset contains 150,000 song lyrics labeled with Spotify Valence scores, which range from 0 to 1 and indicate the emotional positivity of a song (1 being highly positive). Important variables include artist (artist name), seq (song lyrics), song (song title), and label (valence score). The seq column requires preprocessing, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization, while label serves as the target for mood prediction. Additional steps include handling missing values, balancing the valence distribution, and potentially engineering features like word sentiment or linguistic complexity. After merging Spotify Analysis and Visualization with 150K Lyrics Labeled with Spotify Valence, we renamed the 'song', 'popularity', 'year', 'genre', 'seq' columns to match the columns from the first dataset, Audio features and lyrics of Spotify songs.  We then filtered the years to be between 2000 and 2023, and made sure to filter the dataframe to only include the pop, rock, r&b, and rap genres. We then merged that combined dataframe ( Spotify Analysis and 150K Lyrics Labeled with Spotify Valence) with the first dataset, Audio features and lyrics of Spotify songs to have one large, organized dataset that focuses on specific years and genres.
